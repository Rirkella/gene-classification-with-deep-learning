# Gene Classification with Deep Learning

In this project, I aim to learn how to predict protein-coding genes based on their nucleotide sequences. This project serves as an educational endeavor, however has the potential to be applied in various scientific and practical domains, from basic genomics research to biomedical applications and beyond.

Developed from scratch using online data, the project signifies my effort to apply ML and DL methods to biological sequence data, driven by a motivation to address real-life challenges.

## The main objective
Develop a machine learning model for the purpose of identifying protein-coding sequences based solely on their DNA nucleotide sequences. A binary classification method will be applied to achieve this goal.


## Data Description
For this project, I utilized raw data from the GENCODE release 44 project (17.07.23), which compiles information about the human genome. I obtained two files: Comprehensive gene annotation of the human genome and Transcript sequences, which contain nucleotide sequences of all transcripts on the reference chromosomes.

## Project Plan
- Process the available files, merge them into a single dataframe, and define features and labels for analysis.
- Encode the letter sequences appropriately for training machine learning models.
- Create several models, including a neural network, assess their performance, and outline plans for improving the deep learning model.
